[INFO] [1719039530.219356]: Input: Sure, I'd be happy to help you compare the engines of these two cars.

The first car, the 2012 BMW 3 Series Sedan, comes with two engine options: a 2.0L I-4 and a 3.0L I-6. The 2.0L engine has a horsepower rating of up to 240, while the 3.0L engine's horsepower rating is not specified.

The second car, the 2012 Audi A5 Coupe, is equipped with a 2.0L I-4 engine that produces 211 horsepower.

So, in terms of engine size and horsepower, the BMW 3 Series Sedan offers a larger engine option and potentially more horsepower, depending on the specific engine chosen. However, the Audi A5 Coupe's 2.0L engine has a higher horsepower rating than the 2.0L engine in the BMW.

I hope this information helps you in your car-buying decision! Let me know if you have any other questions.
